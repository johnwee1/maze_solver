## maze_solver
a totally unnecessary maze solver that reads in a maze and samples the image for color values. The maze needs to be a grid thats black and white with square pixels.

Mazes can be generated from https://keesiemeijer.github.io/maze-generator/#generate with a default wall thickness of 10 pixels and 20 * 20 (but for some reason its a 40x40 grid).
